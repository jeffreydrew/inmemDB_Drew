# In Memory Database

## Description
There is no set up needed and the project does not rely on external db files, the core.py file is ready to run as is.


All functions print a brief description of the action they are performing.


The example from the assignment is included in the main function, but new functions can be added and tested.


## Write up for becoming an official assignment
Honestly this was a great assignment, decently intutitive, definitely requires some puzzle solving, very fun. 


The instructions are very clear already, but I think it would be helpful to clarify before putting the description of the get and put functions that put can only be called during a transaction, and get can be called at any time. I think it would also be exciting to have the assignment simulate a real bank transaction. So if there is money added to one account and not deducted from the other, for example, that would be an error. This assigment could be through gradescope for grading to be automated, and just have example unit tests for students.
